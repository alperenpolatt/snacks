 Today's, most of people can not find a fully employed job. However, they have to work somewhere temporarily until they find a formal job. And Employers sometimes need a daily employee in any sector. But the important fact here is it is only needed for one day. This project plays a role as an intermediary between employers and employee. This app will allow to employers to find daily employees for their need. And employees have a chance of finding a daily job by choosing employers' register. My aim is to make to find a daily job easily to unemployed people and employers as soon as possible to easily uses. In this project, I have firstly planned to written a web service which contains my business logic. And my service responds client side application. I have planned to create a web application. If a mobile application is needed in the future, my service is ready for this aim. Now I have developed a single page web application. Thus, an employee will be able to find a daily job by choosing job applications.
